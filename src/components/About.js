        <p>
   I’m Pritee Gupta, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Engineering and Science at NIT Manipur. I have a real passion for web development, and I love diving into both the front-end and back-end to create full-stack applications. My go-to technologies are React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
</p>
<p>
  I also enjoy using Git and GitHub to keep my projects organized and collaborative. In addition to my web development skills, I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which allows me to solve complex problems efficiently. I’m always curious and eager to learn, I’m excited about the opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects and work with others in the tech community.
