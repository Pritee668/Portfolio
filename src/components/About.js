        <p>
          Hey there! I’m Pritee Gupta, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Engineering and Science at NIT Manipur. I have a real passion for web development, and I love diving into both the front-end and back-end to create full-stack applications. My go-to technologies are React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also enjoy using Git and GitHub to keep my projects organized and collaborative. I’m always curious and eager to learn, so I like to explore new frameworks and tools to sharpen my skills. I’m excited about the opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects and work with others in the tech community.
